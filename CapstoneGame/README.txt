This git repository is meant to showcase the development and thought process behind the capstone game.

Preliminarily, the capstone game is going to be a continuation of the walking sim. The general thought process for the capstone game
is to create something that is continuously immersive. I want the player to feel confusion at first, in a minimally rendered world.
As they continue through the path and journey, they should subconsciously notice that the world around them is becoming more complete.
Part of this immersion is the passage of time, which I want to be directly proportional to the movement of the player. 

I want the game to essentially be constructed in a straight line, where the sun will change its position over time. This will be done by
having the sun move through different phases with relation to the game itself. While technically the sun is always moving, it will be progressing
to two different points with every step the player takes.

	1. When the game starts, the sun will be in front of the player. This will create a blinding effect, as if awakening from a hibernation.
	   At this point of the game, the world will be minimally rendered, perhaps there won't even be color to the floor and surroundings,
	   which will ideally go on forever.
		
	   With every step the player takes, the world around them will continue to develop, and the sun will move out of direct sight, subsequently
	   being less blinding.
